What the BBC found out that they didn&#39;t reveal in this video is that us skeptics brainwashed Michael Mann and Phil Jones into acting like crooks through thought induction. We do this through channeling thought waves through a Ouija board. The average person when reading the Climategate E-mails would believe that Michael Mann and Phil Jones are dishonest crooks but they really aren&#39;t. It was our evil plan to make them look like totally dishonest, morally corrupt, climate assholes.... IT WAS US TRICKY CLIMATE CHANGE DENIERS AND OUR TRICKY TRICKINESS !.... I feel better now that I have come clean and I thank the always honest BBC for not relaying my criminal behavior to the police.

Noticeable STEP changes. Not linear as one would expect, but step changes with no variability in between steps.<br />So what did I discover? Each step took place as a new technology was introduced. Things like weather balloons, hurricane hunters and satellites <i>(there was at least one more major breakthrough in spotting hurricanes I&#39;m forgetting).</i><br />Now when I look at all those temperature graphs claiming global warming, I can&#39;t help but notice the same pattern. There was NO warming until 1970s and then it went through the roof. What happened around that time? Satellites.<br />And thus, suddenly, in just 50 years climate seemingly went to shit.

It was a clear and deliberate plan to obfuscate, manipulate and hide evidence (sic). There&#39;s no other conclusion that can be drawn from those actions. What&#39;s more the person who released them was clearly an insider among the same group but came forward the only way they could. Had this been other than left wing psudo science garbage it would have been painted as a revelation and seized upon as fact by the same set of groupthinkers who defended the demonstrable intention revealed within the emails. That being said it was a clever defence... only half wits would fall for it.	UCmoLzd-F2pkTKLmFz5rJ5iw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmoLzd-F2pkTKLmFz5rJ5iw	0

And it was goodies v the baddies, experts v the dummies. where in this documentary were the likes of Steve Macintyre? Indeed, Macintyre is fundamental to this whole thing. But Macintyre is too much of an expert for comfort, I suspect. I don&#39;t know who&#39;s right on this but I do know that &#39;the believers&#39; like Michael Mann and Steve Jones are prepared to step outside the science.

If you want to dispute the climate gate e-mails ( which you are free to ) why don&#39;t you interview non-alarmist scientists ( yes they do exist ) on the context instead of politicians. <br /><br /><br />This video has nothing to do with &#39;how climate sceptics tricked the public&#39; - they didn&#39;t trick anyone ; they just exposed what was going on behind the scenes in a series of e-mails - but comes across as trying to convince people on the street that climate change is real and that man is responsible.

Those things we can work on. But climate change we’ll guess what the climate does change and Mother Earth controls that not us. Do you know how many things are involved to study climate. And some of those things are unpredictable,like volcanoes and the sun. Then there is the fact that in earths history the earth has been way warmer while the co2 was low and other times when co2 was high while temps were low and other times where temps have risen and then about 500 yrs later co2 climbed but I haven’t seen where co2 went up first and then the temps increased it probably has happened over the multi millions of yrs. Look up agenda 21 Agenda 30 Seven 50. Next al gore is a virtual signallers,do as I say but not as I do. And DiCaprio with his jet planes and yacht Anyway I spent yrs believing global warming ,I never virtual signalled ,I just did my bit,which was not having any carbon footprints( children). I don’t take overseas trips every yr etc etc. But those virtual signalling ( like the latest prince harry) and other entertainers do fly overseas all the time,also why isn’t gore doing conference calls etc instead of using that evil stuff called fossil fuels to travel the world to spread their money making fears scam. Again I was once blind and blindly believed Now I know just how wrong I was. Please take weather ,weather is small and local ,yet our weather ppl still get this small thing called weather wrong,so what makes anyone think that scientists can get something so big so complicated and so complex as the earths climate ,what makes you think they can predict it and what it will be like in say ten yrs or even longer. And why aren’t we protesting in China,China doesn’t have a dome over it keeping their co2 in their area. So the west could get this so called nasty stuff called co2 down to zero but guess what China will put enough up for all the countries. Please ask common sense questions and look at who benefits from this. Lastly they now call it climate change when for two good decades they called it global warming, so if it snows guess what they will blame us and say it’s because of us. That’s my prediction. Watch their pockets get fat while doing exactly what they tell us not to do.	UC0t7Jj1mjmJHmCoGYIGI1yA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0t7Jj1mjmJHmCoGYIGI1yA	1	Ugwmmr0af6m0MVhmAXp4AaABAg	Sam Lair

Perhaps 11,000 years ago when global temps started rising to end the last ice age, human made C02 cause that as well, right? The shift in the magnetic poles have weakened the protective layers of the ionosphere allowing more of the sun’s rays to heat up oceans, boiling off more of that largest storehouse of C02, releasing it into the atmosphere. It is the sun that is causing temps to rise, dah. This is not new information, just information that you have been taught to ignore.

Slipshod self serving group think reporting gave cover for the criminals behind the theft and abuse of the communications. Sell the controversy, the sizzle, the lies. In return more viewers, clicks, advertising resulting in higher revenue. Even this attempt to correct is weak tea giving voice to liars and frauds. THE SCIENCE IS CRYSTAL CLEAR. IT HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR 150 YEARS. THE VERY FIRST PRESENTATION ON THE HEAT TRAPPING ABILITY OF CO2 WAS AT THE ROYAL INSTITUTION IN LONDON 150 YEARS AGO. The BBC has total access to the data facts and figures. No where in this video does the BBC attempt to present facts. Instead BBC once again presents he said she said bullshit. I&#39;ll end with a couple of the facts. A gallon of gas weighs 6.3 pounds. When burnt the gases combine with oxygen in the atmosphere producing 19 pounds of CO2. Each day humans add over 100 million tons PER DAY to the air. 40 BILLION TONS PER YEAR. THIS FACT ALONE IS DAMMING EVIDENCE.

Ugy7YKh1H252uCXbljx4AaABAg	5	7	2019-07-22 23:03:21	Christopher Calder	<b>The BBC has sunken into the depths of group-think powered hysteria.</b> There is hope for sanity. Two PhD scientists with remarkable mathematics skills, Dr. Ned Nikolov and Dr. Karl Zeller, studied NASA space probe data and found that there is no atmospheric greenhouse gas effect on Earth or on any planet or moon in our solar system. What determines average planetary temperature is distance from the Sun, which controls the amount of collected solar radiation, and atmospheric mass, which creates total planetary atmospheric pressure. The pull of gravity on atmospheric gases causes compression which creates heat in the same way gas compression heating in a diesel engine eliminates the need for a spark plug. This is called an adiabatic process. Without it, Earth’s oceans would freeze to the equator. Adding more CO2 to our atmosphere will make plants grow faster, bigger, and more resistant to drought. There is no atmospheric greenhouse gas effect to worry about on Earth or anywhere.

The omitted data suggested that African American males who received the MMR vaccine before age 36 months were at increased risk for autism. Decisions were made regarding which findings to report after the data were collected, and I believe that the final study protocol was not followed.&quot;.... <br /> <br />Dr. William Thompson, CDC <b>WHISTLEBLOWER</b> ...still one of their TOP Scientist (he&#39;s protected, thank God). In August of 2014, Dr. Thompson came forward and stated: He conducted a FRAUDULENT Study, his Colleagues conducted a FRAUDULENT Study and Top CDC Admins conducted a FRAUDULENT Study, that was ordered by Congress via the DOJ. The study in question was the last Federally funded study that looked at the Causation Correlation concept between the MMR Vaccine &amp; Autism. Sadly, all of these Scientist &amp; Admins OMITTED Scientific Data (Data-sets), that demonstrated Causation Correlation between the MMR Vaccine &amp; Autism. They ALL Violated the Scientific Method. <br /> <br />In a science experiment, One is not allowed to OMIT data that does NOT fit the Scientists Hypothesis, this is FRAUD. A scientists is supposed to adjust their Hypothesis based upon the data collected, not the other way around. Due to the Conflicts of Interest/Corruption that exists within the CDC, FDA, NIH, HHS, etc. not even Science is safe or effective in the United States or with our Allies as a matter of Fact. <br /> <br /><b>African American Males have a 340% INCREASED RISK of an Autism Diagnosis, IF that CHILD receives the MMR Vaccine PRIOR to 36 months of age. FACT!!</b> <br /> <br />This was the data-set (Scientific Findings) the CDC Covered up &amp; literally threw in the Trash. When Dr. Thompson was ordered, along with his Colleagues to dispose of this information. Dr. Thompson knew it was a violation of Federal Laws, like FOIA and he kept all of his data. He gave Congress (Posey (FL)) over 10,000 pages of this evidence as PROOF of the FRAUDULENT SCIENCE. Sadly, since <b>our Congress &amp; Senate are CORRUPT as well.....Nothing has come about because of this? Not even so much as a WARNING to AFRICAN AMERICAN PARENTS ???? Sadly, the DOJ has FAILED to ACT as well, which confirms their CORRUPTION! The Scientific Journal &quot;Pediatrics&quot;</b> that published the paper, has yet to RETRACT the paper, despite the testimony of FRAUD, by a Author, so the <b>Pediatrics Journal is CORRUPT, a worth-less RAG!</b> <br /> <br /><b>What I have stated is a FACT and not up for debate</b> .....as if anyone could debate these FACTS anyways, but simply IGNORING the 10,000 pages of EVIDENCE and Testimony of Dr. William Thompson is the norm today. There&#39;s no way to disprove/debunk this, one can read Dr. Thompson&#39;s Testimony &amp; Listen to Congressman Posey&#39;s statements before Congress. <br /> <br />Next.....Research Dr. Judy Mikovitz <b>WHISTLEBLOWER</b> An accredited Scientists that has exposed Retro-Viruses that exist within EVERY Vaccine. Retro-Viruses are viruses that reside in other animal kingdoms and when injected in Mammals, can lay dormant, but upon activation, can create a firestorm of illness (Your Dr. won&#39;t have a clue what&#39;s wrong). SV40 is such a Retro-Virus, that resides within the Polio Vaccine, which has contributed to the mass epidemic of 1,000.000&#39;s of Cancers we see today. Once again, despite Dr. Mikovitz alerting the Alphabet Soup Regulators, Congress, Senate, etc. regarding the DANGERS concerning Retro-Viruses, our Federal SHILLS still remain SILENT, protecting BigPharma&#39;s Bottom-Line, instead of protecting Human Life. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8T30xzES30">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8T30xzES30</a> <br /> <br /><b>What everyone should know &amp; consider about Vaccines :</b> <br />1.

At the end of this conference, you&#39;ll get to listen to an <b>angel named &quot;Rachael&quot; (#112 CURED of ASD).</b> Who will melt your HEART as she encourages all the parents not to give up hope and allows us all, another insight into the sickness known as Autism . At the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lslIyHo6zg&amp;t=55m00s">55:00</a> mark, you can listen to this darling tell you the TRUTH and remember, IF Western Medicine had it their way.....Rachael would be a CUSTOMER (bottom-line) for life, instead of being Healthy &amp; Healed to live a full life. <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5W_ky0RH8A&amp;index=12&amp;list=PLejXj_8qB3HM6NYYXpq6GjQ_n__DcrTL7&amp;t=3295s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5W_ky0RH8A&amp;index=12&amp;list=PLejXj_8qB3HM6NYYXpq6GjQ_n__DcrTL7&amp;t=3295s </a><br /> <br />Per MIT statisticians, they estimate by 2025-32 every other CHILD Born in the United States (ONLY) will be Autistic. Today, it&#39;s 1 in 36 Born are Autistic...and in Boys, it&#39;s 1 in 28. The Poisoning of America&#39;s Children is going to END the United States as we know it, at the very least Bankrupt it. This issue is so SERIOUS, the DATA is so Disturbing, yet it is being IGNORED by everyone in the Mainstream, even the CURE for Autism is being IGNORED. Disgraceful Remorseless Human Beings are running the show. <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p61oTEGMxJg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p61oTEGMxJg </a><br /> <br />We ALL should ASSUME... <b>That ALL VACCINES now contain the CARCINOGEN known as Glyphosate-Weed-KILLER &amp; 1/3rd of ALL Vaccines now contain ARSENIC!</b> A study done in January 30th, 2017 out of Germany CONFIRMED it. You&#39;ll want to look under : Potentiell toxische Elemente/Potential Toxic Elements &amp; Arsen-Gesamt/Arsenic Total Here&#39;s a couple links on the Scientific Study. <br />https://www.impfkritik.de//pressespiegel/2017020402.html <br /><a href="http://www.agbug.de/download/impfstoff02.pdf">http://www.agbug.de/download/impfstoff02.pdf</a> Spectrum Analysis Results on 16 Vaccines <br /> <br />– ALL vaccines tested contained mercury in small amounts (even the ones that were supposedly “mercury free”). <br />– Half the vaccines contained toxic, carcinogenic nickel in small amounts. <br />– Slightly over 1/3 of the tested vaccines contained small amounts of arsenic. <br />– Over 90% of the tested vaccines contained uranium (yes, the stuff used to make nuclear bombs). <br />– ALL tested vaccines contain minor traces of aluminum, <b>even if not labeled</b> . <br />– The aluminum content in the so-called attenuated vaccines is around 1000-6000X times above the safe limits for drinking water! And these vaccines are supposedly “safer”? By the way, aluminum adjuvants commonly used in vaccines have been identified by immunologists as a trigger for later development of food allergies in children. <br /> <br />MomsacrossAmerica tested 5 Vaccines and ALL had Round-up/Glyphosate in them. Glyphosate is a CA Prop 65 Carcinogen &amp; listed as a Group 2A with the WHO/IARC, &quot;Probable Carcinogen to Humans&quot;. A TOXIN is a TOXIN, no matter the ppb or excuse given. MOMS are doing the JOB of our Federal Alphabet Agencies are supposed to do....so sad, but way to go MOMS!!!! (show&#39;em how it&#39;s DONE!) Here&#39;s a link, enjoy! These Spectrum Analyzed results (EVIDENCE) were sent to Congress, Senate, HHS, CDC, etc. and ALL IGNORED the DATA, which is what PAID SHILLS do, naturally :) <br /> <a href="http://www.momsacrossamerica.com/glyphosate_in_childhood_vaccines">http://www.momsacrossamerica.com/glyphosate_in_childhood_vaccines</a> <br /> <br />In addition, Dr. Anthony Samsel also tested over a DOZEN Vaccines and found that over 90% of the VACCINES, contained the TOXIN ROUND-UP! Multiple labs were used in the test, to maintain objectivity. He as well sent these Scientific Findings to Congress, Senate, CDC, NIH, FDA, HHS, EPA, WHO and they haven&#39;t done SHIT about it. These Alphabet Agency&#39;s simply IGNORED the DATA (FACTS), just like Dr. William Thompson&#39;s testimony was IGNORED (FACT).

Ugz6dEsURLCbqDlSGTt4AaABAg	1	7	2019-07-13 16:44:58	Frey Faust	* In 2009, an unknown individual(s) released more than 1,000 emails (many dealing with proxy studies) from the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Unit (CRU). The materials were authored by some of the world’s leading climate scientists and accompanied by the following note:<br />We feel that climate science is too important to be kept under wraps. We hereby release a random selection of correspondence, code, and documents. Hopefully it will give some insight into the science and the people behind it.[147] [148]<br /><br />* These emails (commonly referred to as the ClimateGate emails) show IPCC scientists and authors:<br /><br /> proposing to conduct an “honest” study about the “uncertainties” of proxies and then “publish, retire, and don’t leave a forwarding address,” because “what I almost think I know to be the case, the results of this study will show” that we “honestly know f**k-all” [i.e., little or nothing] about temperature changes in the Northern Hemisphere over more than a hundred years.”[149] [150]<br /> writing, “I know there is pressure to present a nice tidy story as regards ‘apparent unprecedented warming in a thousand years or more in the proxy data’ but in reality the situation is not quite so simple. … I believe that the recent warmth was probably matched about 1000 years ago.”[151]<br /> writing, “I tried hard to balance the needs of the science and the IPCC, which were not always the same.”[152]<br /> writing, “In my (perhaps too harsh) view, there have been a number of dishonest presentations of model results by individual authors and by IPCC.”[153]<br /> planning to have the editor of a scientific journal “ousted” if he exhibits skepticism of global warming.[154]<br /> instructing each other to delete emails relating to the 2007 IPCC report.[155]<br /> planning to evade Britain’s Freedom of Information Act.[156]<br /> planning to boycott scientific journals that require authors to release all data and calculations used in their published papers.[157]<br /> writing, “I feel rather uncomfortable about using not only unpublished but also unreviewed material as the backbone of our conclusions (or any conclusions). … Essentially, I feel that at this point there are very little rules and almost anything goes. I think this will set a dangerous precedent which might mine the IPCC credibility, and I am a bit uncomfortable that now nearly everybody seems to think that it is just ok to do this.”[158]<br /> writing, “it would be nice to try to ‘contain’ the putative ‘MWP’ [Medieval Warm period], even if we don’t yet have a hemispheric mean reconstruction available that far back.”[159]<br /> planning to shorten the timeframe of a proxy data series so “it would do what we want.”[160]<br /> creating a diagram of raw proxy data to see if it “provided” an “obvious” picture of “unprecedented warming over the last millennium or so”—and then burying this diagram over concerns that it may “dilute the message about the strength of 20th century mean warming.”[161] [162] (Click here for comprehensive facts about this email.)<br /> writing, “I’ve just completed Mike’s Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years (i.e., from 1981 onwards) and from 1961 for Keith’s to hide the decline.”[163] (Click here for comprehensive facts about this email.)

A three-part Penn State University cleared scientist Michael Mann of wrongdoing. Two reviews commissioned by the University of East Anglia"supported the honesty and integrity of scientists in the Climatic Research Unit." A UK Parliament report concluded that the emails have no bearing on our understanding of climate science and that claims against UEA scientists are misleading. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Inspector General's office concluded there was no evidence of wrongdoing on behalf of their employees. The National Science Foundation's Inspector General's office concluded, "Lacking any direct evidence of research misconduct...we are closing this investigation with no further action." Other agencies and media outlets have investigated the substance of the emails. The Environmental Protection Agency, in response to petitions against action to curb heat-trapping emissions, dismissed attacks on the science rooted in the stolen emails. Factcheck.org debunked claims that the emails put the conclusions of climate science into question. Politifact.com rated claims that the emails falsify climate science as "false."

That&#39;s because it&#39;s a false claim. Phil Jones infamously threatened to destroy his evidence, rather than submit it to those asking for it. This is not how science is done.<br />The use of &quot;hide the decline&quot; can be seen in the Hockey-Stick graph, where the &quot;trick&quot; is adding the thermometer data to a tree-ring proxy series.<br />This is NEVER done in real science. There IS a decline in what the tree-ring series shows, yet this is deemed &quot;inaccurate&quot;...<br /><br /><br />The e-mails are NOT taken out of context; and any claim that this is so highlights the dishonesty, as any study of the actual data will show.<br /><br /><br />Michael Mann&#39;s &#39;HockeyStick&#39; has first ignored - then demolished - Hubert Lamb&#39;s record which shows the Mediaeval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, as if it never happened.<br />Lamb&#39;s graph appears in the IPCC&#39;s first Assessment Report [AR1]; and disappears after Mann&#39;s phoney 1998 reconstruction, yet no-one tries to explain this - or even to address it.<br /><br /><br />The exoneration of the CRU scientists by Penn State and in the UK is a gross miscarriage of justice, for which all the academics involved should be ashamed.

At least one of the researchers, Jyrki Kauppinen, is a member of Clexit which therefore reveals him to be a fossil fuel industry shill. The research paper hasn't even been peer reviewed so the content and conclusions have not acquired the status of scientifically validated to date. The research paper attempts to give low cloud unjustifiable weight as an influence of climate. I fail to see the point of your comment.

Ugw_D2LvpIqDmsqTfet4AaABAg	1	0	2019-07-12 01:31:48	Cyd Oman	One of the few sensible actions of President Bush II was to spotlight climate change in another more pragmatic way. He simply didn&#39;t involve climate change in the problem in order to start responding to its danger. Was it so immediately important that we, as a single nation, take on the largest responsibility for correcting climate change? Many people balked at that challenge. <br /><br />There was neither the political will nor the national sanity in the first decade of the twenty-first century to form a cohesive policy around climate change. Some maintain there still isn&#39;t. But that did not stop efforts to combat it totally. In fact we have seen many of the solutions to fossil fuel use show up as a result of research that was supposed to downsize our dependence on foreign oil. <br /><br />Perhaps we didn&#39;t get as far as many wanted, but Bush did find a way forward that avoided dug in heels. And he challenged the power of climate deniers to dominate the conversation when he framed the problem in terms of addressing the high costs of hurricanes and huge inland floods, the impact of a devastating earthquake on shore cities like LA, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle. Any large city on the East Coast could suffer expensive, overwhelming damage from hurricanes and did. Any area in tornado alley was a target for tornado damage but so were large metropolitan cities in the upper and middle midwest. Straight line winds, hail, deep snow falls, blizzards, weeks long freezing temperatures from polar vortexes - all these products of weather destruction were reasons to improve infrastructure, influence improvements in preparedness, acknowledge that catastrophic weather, like all natural disasters travels at its own time and own pleasure - across national borders, across states, across different terrains, across time zones, across area codes and zip codes, districts of Representation and shows no favoritism to political parties, religious beliefs, skin color, age, sex or social status. <br /><br />Dealing with the effects of wild fires, drought, floods, earthquakes - all of these dangers present as much damage (or more) as terror attacks, pestilence, invasive species and airport traffic jams. <br /><br />Bush made dealing with natural disasters a central, essential need and that helped, in the long run, to keep the nation focused on topics that made research and data collection on weather-related calamities a part of national security, an acceptable conversation that did not trigger an endless back and forth argument that simply stifled all productive action. <br /><br />When so much of our national cohesion has been obliterated by the violence of our President and his pride in &quot;counter-punching&quot; (actually really verbal bullying and verbal aggression) triggered by even feeble insults, it is important to remember the past benefits of Presidents who can find significant ways to improve the national well-being even under the most chaotic and stifling of situations. When we understand there is always a way forward, and, by the grace of God and our own best versions of ourselves, that we can get back to that place again, we still have a chance. There are lights in the distance to lead us forward.	UCPHlh5xy9YBHrtJId3ej7Fg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPHlh5xy9YBHrtJId3ej7Fg	0

But perhaps it still a good thing to conserve some carbon stocks. But I am a skeptic. Why? I have read the data that has been revealed by those who showed Mann lied. These are climate scientists and physicists who know their subject as well as anyone. But of course everyone wants to be the one who "saves the planet." Nothing wrong with that idea, perhaps, but for this - The data do not correlate with CO2 being any main cause; not yet. LESS than 0.04% CO2 having increased by 0.015 over 100 years (by 150 parts per million) is rather like someone who was used to putting 1 teaspoon of sugar in their coffee now complaining that someone was adding 1 more grain of sugar - there is probably no way that we can tell if this increase is significant for temperature. NONE of the models have been proven correct, and the sun and water vapour are still the major factors.

Some deny that Man could possibly emit enough CO2 to change the climate. The facts and fingerprinting prove they’re cretins.

Ugw1_bJ3NArosOe6Le14AaABAg	3	0	2019-07-11 08:30:03	Frey Faust	The climate catastrophists make several fatal errors when they argue for their POV. 1. They are completely unskeptical about a subject which is very obviously controversial among climate scientists and earth scientists in general. There is no such thing as a partial consensus. Consensus is total or it is not consensus. Consensus is a matter of opinion, not scientific protocol for proof. Absolute conviction in a scientist is already suspicious, but when its about a controversial subject, that discredits them utterly. 2. They want to have us all believe that the trace of a trace gas that humans contribute to is the driver for a gigantic, chaotic system with enormous forces and thousands of contributing elements. They look at the entire past and present dynamics and imagine co2 everywhere. This is not science. 3. The scientists at the IPCC were caught red handed in the late 1990s cooking the graphs to make the past temperature record colder and steady. They should all have been fired, but were never punished. When Catastrophic AGW people make claims and use materials from the IPCC, they cannot be taken seriously. 4. The Catastrophists attempt to make co2 seem toxic. Co2 is not a toxin, any more than oxygen. Co2 is as vital to life on the planet as oxygen and water. 400 ppm is already homeopathic compared to periods in the past when it was 1000s of ppm and life was flourishing. 150 ppm is the level at which all life would and has died. At 400 ppm, the current global level is LOW. 600 is common under a forest canopy. 2k to 3k on a submarine or in the space station. Co2 is pumped into actual greenhouses at 1000s of ppm because it helps with photosynth and water uptake. Without Co2 we would not be able to digest or breathe. 5. They claim that the oil companies are holding back research and are buying off their opposition. Actually, the oil industry has its head down and is funding alternative energy research and giving a lot to the IPCC. The real catastrophy is the one these snake oil salesmen would instigate if they were successful at making everyone hysterical enough to panic. Not to mention the billions they are siphoning up in tax dollars for their phony models and ridiculous prognostications, not one of which has come true. And this is the last and most damning evidence of the lie, the absolutely stunning record of failed predictions over the last 30 years. A very important aspect of any scientific theory is that it must predict effects. When the predictions fail, the theory has been disproven.

The "burning"(oxidation) of hydrocarbons in our combustion devices is the exact same thing the earth does with it's internal combustion. When an internal combustion engine "burns" hydrocarbons it liberates/converts them, some remains in the engine as carbon, the rest comes out the tail pipe in the form of oxides, H2O, carbon, etc, etc, basic science explains the process. The same process is what happens with earths internal combustion engine, it burns hydrocarbons, and what comes out of the tail pipe/s (volcanoes, fissures, etc) lava is just one byproduct of this combustion and the thin slime coating of "oil" is just the "semi liquid hydrocarbons" that have oozed to the surface, it's bitumen, about the same structure as the creosote that will ooze out of a wood or coal stove when burning those "hydrocarbons", earths "coal stove" is a few million times bigger than any stove humans have, and it's internal combustion never goes out or does it stop producing bitumen, NEW OIL! Peak oil is a lie, the scarcity of oil is a lie, 50 years is a lie, some old oil wells/fields that have been pumped dry have been found to have "mysteriously" refilled themselves. They find new fields all the time and even with the amount of hydrocarbons humans "convert" every day, earth seems to keep up with us and produces more "hydrocarbons" faster than we can convert them.

Sydney harbour has been measuring sea level for over 200 years and it shows a constant rise of 2.3mm a year due to land glacier melting and sea level did drop from late 2015 until late 2018 that’s nasa fact. Regarding the sea ice, if all the sea ice melted tomorrow the sea level would hardly rise ( it would only rise because of the small amount of salt in the ice ) sea ice is just like a boat it displaces it’s weight so when it melts it stays at the same level as before, it’s basic scientific fact. https://youtu.be/Dzb8FljvGGI	UC5rDkzVYJvFh80oc-0XDhiA	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5rDkzVYJvFh80oc-0XDhiA	1	Ugwm3f7fNlmsthYQlut4AaABAg	Gazza

Sea levels rising across all decades, and it's really REALLY hard to find even a 3-year span that a cherry picker could call a drop. It's a silly exercise. Now that both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice is melting, it seems the cherry picks are getting very slim indeed.

Your forgetting the basic principles of science, and then to refuse to debate others who are using the after the event factual data for fear of losing is just plain anti scientific because scientific measurement of after the event collated data will show that I’m correct and that you are the denier. Here’s one basic after the event measurement that you can look at now and go onto the nasa website and check instantly, sea level started dropping from late 2015 until late 2018 and during that same period Greenland’s ice increased according to nasa own studies, go look for yourself.

Not sure if you ever had a science class, but you seem to have a fundamental tax misunderstanding about how science is performed. We would all LOVE to see great peer-reviews work disprove the basics. But that's not happening. There is no "opposing view" because that's gut feelings, not science. And why hold debates with someone who has no peer-reviews work?. Should heart surgeons debate some random person because that person has an "opposite view" to heart surgery?

Heartland convinced many people that smoking was good for them, and today serves two purposes: tell you that second-hand smoke if OK for your children, and that all climate scientists are wrong but their little band of no-degree and political science people are experts. Some of the cigarette denier &quot;scientists&quot; at Heartland moved onto climate science denial.<br /><br />I think every thinking person should insist that deniers look into Exxon&#39;s own reporting (that they kept hidden) and the BEST program. BEST took a few skeptic scientists (some outright deniers) and funded them with Koch money. But an interesting thing happened when real science was performed: they came to the same conclusions that all other science organizations came to. Remarkable, no?

The historic record indicates that temp increases first and CO2 follows hundreds of years later. Antarctic ice cores have shown that. Even your favorite website SkepticalScience admits it and as they always do they twist it to show the unmistakable influence man has on climate. As far as CO2 being food, well, you know as well as I do that CO2 is required for plants to grow which means we get to eat plant food and continue living. You don't know this but over the last 50 years the earth has gotten greener and cereal crop yields have increased dramatically. Go to the U.S. Department of Agriculture website and check it out. I would say that when Boran said "CO2 is literally our food" you really knew what he meant. It must be a horrible thing for you and your catastrophic global warming B.S. that CO2 might not be causing devastation but people all over the world might be getting enough to eat.

Yes, that is the level to which your sort always lowers when you are confronted with blatant facts. Sold and swearing Congratulations for the educational contribution to the discussion. "disgruntled scientist "? This man, Peter Ridd, is a coral reef expert. He has been studying the Great Barrier Reef for more than 25 years. The man therefore knows what he is talking about. But that's not what it's about, it's about the way he was treated by climate change dictators. Fortunately, thanks to the help of third parties, he was able to defend himself and he appealed to the court against his dismissal. The court ruled in favor of Peter Ridd across the board and the university has to pay him a hefty compensation. We are always presented with doom scenarios about things that we cannot actually check on the spot. Which of us can check if the polar bears are doing well? Which of us can check whether the Great Barrier Reef is doing well? Which of us can check whether the ice is melting in Greenland? At these temperatures? https://www.ventusky.com/?p=28;57;1&l=temperature-2m&t=20191003/2300 I hope your geography is good enough to find Greenland on this map. You also do not notice that doom screenwriters always talking about places on earth where the average person usually doesn't get the chance to visit. And, yes, CO2 is food for us. Growers who grow plants (food) in greenhouses, pump extra CO2 into their greenhouses to make the plants grow better. No fertilizer that can compete with that. Even outside the greenhouses the effect is visible. https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth If the CO2 ratio in the atmosphere falls below a level of 150 ppm, then there is no longer any plant growth. No more plants, no more animals and no more humans. No more life on earth. Perhaps that is the next vision of the climate amlarmists, then the planet is saved from all living things that are only burdening and polluting this planet. Tidy is neat. At the end of the last glacial, the CO2 level in the atmosphere had dropped to 180 ppm. Only 30 ppm above this critical limit. This was due to the low temperature on earth, because you see, a lower temperature causes less, an a higher temperature more CO2 in the atmosphere. Melting Glaciers? This study of three glaciers in the Alps over a period of 3,000 years, shows that during the warm Roman climate optimum and the warm medieval climate optimum these glaciers were almost completely melted away. They reached their maximum expansion in three phases during the Little Ice Age, with the greatest expanse in 1859/60, the end of the Little Ice Age. During that maximum expansion in 1859/60, the glaciers penetrated deep into the valleys, into the inhabited areas, where they destroyed buildings and farmland. This was not a local European phenomenon, as the same findings were made in Iceland, Greenland, Canada and Alaska. The shrinkage of the glaciers was probably caused by the Romans with their SUVs.

As for experts- Galileo summed it up- "In questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual." As true now as it was then. Any individual who has asked themselves the question has worked out that human caused climate change by CO2 is the hoax of the century.- The plethora of absolute and bare faced lies and impossibilities, such as the sea becoming more acidic, is a good clue.

That is not a scientific argument, but a position that is common in a dictatorship. That is not how science works. But, this illustrates how stupid the crowd is being held by the propaganda about CO2. CO2 is the building block of life on earth and an indispensable component for plant growth. The plants die below a level of 150 ppm. At the end of the last glacial the CO2 concentration was 180 ppm. Only just above that critical limit. In greenhouses extra CO2 is pumped to increase the growth of the crops, because the plants evolved on earth in an era that the CO2 level was much higher than now. No plants, therefore neither animals nor people. So, yes, you owe your life to CO2.

This false equivalence or false balance - as it is sometimes described when relating to media - is most glaringly obvious in cases where experts of a certain field have come to a consensus whilst politically it remains divisive. Climate change is one such case but more recently Brexit has been too, particularly pertaining to the economic argument for the latter. The most egregious examples of this kind of behaviour in media are the debate sections that are now a staple of the 24hr news cycle. These gladiatorial bouts between two personalities are preferred over more diligent and enlightening interviews of single positions since, they make “great TV” at the expense of informing the viewer.

The kicker was that the scientists performed actual science, and did so with all the raw data they could get ahold of (which is a HUGE amount, needing super computers to process everything unlike that Heller BS) AND made their work open to the public and open sourced. When you asked a "skeptic" if they would believe the results, they said "of course" because they distract real science from NASA or NOAA because apparently science is too liberal for them. Watts said he'd believe the results. Good boi, Anthony! Would any skeptics on this site have said "I'll accept the results" prior to the results?

But so often or systematically so that the majority of accepted science in all fields is just a lie? They can also secure a lot of funding and fame by proving other scientists wrong. They are also interested in protecting their reputations and careers. If there is motivation to lie there is also risk. If there is motivation to lie then is not only to not be controversial but to be controversial when being controversial wins them fame and money. The fact that a lot of practical applications of science actually work reliably seems to indicate that even if scientists mostly lie then their lies are better than the truth for getting things done. 2. "High carbohydrate diets are good for you is a lie." Science provided evidence that the combination of saturated fat and refined carbs in combination was very unhealthy. A high carb/low fat diet without added sugars is a healthier option than some popular alternatives. Knowledge increases but they were not wrong. Lots of fresh fruit and veg aka high carb is still recommended. The traditional Mediterranean diet is the gold standard of diets and proven to be good for long term health. It is high carb but it's important that most carbs are plant fibre in fruit and veg not fried potatoes or white bread. 3. "The establishment covers up criminal activity to protect minorities." There is evidence that the bastion of left wing scientific thinking called "the police" failed to properly bring certain cases to justice. However, the idea that there is no crime committed by white men in northern England that has gone unpunished is a lie. In fact, you can be 100% sure that some of those "ethno nationalist" people who get angry about abuse on facebook or whatever have been abusers themselves. The idea that the press or government are trying to cover up all coverage of crime stories by citizen journalists is fanciful.

Scientists in the pocket of Junk food manufacturers lie for them by telling us their products are good for us. We’ve also been told that high carbohydrate diets are good for us, they have fuelled obesity. The cover up by the establishment of the rape of thousands of girls by Muslim men, the list is endless. For me I have seen the increase in temperature over the last 50 years, I have also experienced first hand the retreat of the glaciers in the mountains. Off course man is influencing climate, but the presentation of it as an absolute truth and wheeling out emotional children will never convince the majority of people. As for the BBC, very biased reporting doesn’t help the case.	UCWMxzA0peTcAcUH4M_ebEHw	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWMxzA0peTcAcUH4M_ebEHw	1	UgxGrvdjVGTaUJiHtuh4AaABAg	foxbat51

Very difficult to prove mans contribution as various natural factors both on the earth and from the suns solar flares as it enters another phase and natural occurrences have possibly a greater impact on CO2. I doubt if this can ever by proved scientifically. It seems there are too many hunches and speculation and the old band wagon rolls on.

Even among us there are strong agreements but equally strong disagreements. And at the end of the day we are just number cruncher's. Planet earth's ability to heal from this current dilema is far more vast than humanity's panic. If we go too far, the planet will wipe us out by denying us food and then return to equilibrium quickly thereafter post humanity. If we wanted to assist the planet quickly, I'd suggest planting a lot of trees and birth control measures (one child families for a couple of hundred years should do it).

Ocean current shifts and/or solar output increase are the most likely triggers. Snowballing effects to enhance the warming with albedo decrease and also large Methane release. this warming trend almost reversed in the next millenium (as you will now have seen). Only to restart again. No cataclysm of sufficient extent has been identified to co-incide with this - and because it's so recent (comparitively speaking) none will be.

Avoid the minutiae of smaller time scales, as it wouldnt be comparing apples with apples. We all realise the global temp has shot up 0.7C in 50 years. but unfortunately we didnt't have sensors milllenia ago to resolve much below 50 yr time frames. It will have done so then too.

Particularly centred on a period around 14,000 years ago. these are things you would absolutely know and not need pointing too if you really knew this subject. the data is widely available. Modern instrumentation wasn't avaiable at the time of course. So i'm talking about changes on a decadal scale or larger. F-gas regulation isn't my land of expertise - but to be kind, it's on the fringes of the topic. I extrapolate data from wx worldwide and help in the programming of GFS models, my expertise is in stratospheric cloud, so we have a slight crossover regarding Ozone. I'm a member of FRmetSoc , which you are not apparently. Now given that we are on the same side of the debate, although I'm the one who calculates the numbers that you are relying on, why are you appearing to be so obstinate? What is your disagreement? that the flux is greater at the moment than it was in the past - even as recently as 14,000 years ago... If it is I'll be one of the first people to know - and I'll let you know if it is.

I note, from your failure to reply, you haven’t published. Most of my work is in unpublished papers and reports but some of it is quoted in Regulation 17 reporting to the EU. Anyway, as I stated, there haven’t been rapid changes in natural conditions. We agree that we are not discussing cataclysmic events. When “around 14,000 years ago” are you talking about. What event is it that you are referring to?	UCRF6PzhNwcnTqf3QAEJaqTg	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRF6PzhNwcnTqf3QAEJaqTg	1	UgzrCj5F9O2PYcVk5RV4AaABAg	Fabrizio
UgzrCj5F9O2PYcVk5RV4AaABAg.8xCw-QCJV9h8xSBkxVI2Op		1	2019-07-16 13:33:46	Alexander Stephens	@Tom Reid there is no need to be profane. there is currently global warming underway at a rate that without other variables being present, is undeniably being assisted by deforerstation, methane and C02 emissions. Aside from extinction events, cataclyisms such as VEI 8 events (supervolcano's) will alter the climate faster than the current rate of change. the most recent example of when global temperature exceeded the current rate of change was around 14,000 years ago, towards the end of the last ice age. But this is based on ice core analysis - which obviously only points to polar conditions and not necessarily global. to halt the current temperature increase two things are required. Massive re-forestation (for Carbon absorpsion) and controversially, population control. Otherwise mother nature will do her own population control by lowering the food supply via climate change. It's unwise to wait on a supervolcano to intervene!	UCr2a2yWDujmwFQP3L7_-r4A	http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr2a2yWDujmwFQP3L7_-r4A	1	UgzrCj5F9O2PYcVk5RV4AaABAg	Fabrizio

You're addressing the fiction as part of the narrative of the fact and all that does is undermine the factual basis which your trying to convey. Investigate and look at the fiction as part of a different story. Which is my other problem with Newsnight, they conflate many issues in order to tell some wider murkier narrative. They enjoy playing "devils advocate" instead of actually just delivering the information. By doing so the reportage is becoming increasingly opinionated. I'd say Panorama is going that way as well. BTW grow a thicker skin. I understand you guys put yourself out there but you have to understand their'll be some blow back and to complain about complainers is not the right way to win people over.

Because it has a negative connotation and the title of this post says enough. So don't tell me the BBC is not biased. If you want to claim that current warming is not a natural process, then you must be able to exclude the natural processes. But science has still not been able to unravel the causes of natural processes. It is therefore extremely arrogant of institutions such as the IPCC to ignore natural processes. A stable climate on earth is non-existent, it does not exist, it has never existed and it will never exist. You have to reason from that context. All media reports that ignore this context, intentionally or unintentionally, lose their value and can be considered as propaganda.

BTW carbon dioxide levels have actually lagged some of those previous temperature increases not preceded them. That is assuming that we really can measure past gas concentrations!

Stop thinking your smarter than everyone else after watching a couple YouTube videos.. we all have access to the same information you do..

Would we teach children math the same way ? "Jane thinks 2+2=5. How many of us think she might be wrong?".. Do you see how dumb that sounds. That's cute that you know the difference between correlation and causation. Do you imagine the literal thousands of scientists out there working to save your ass from a problem you think isn't real didn't get their A Levels ? We all know that.. They do too.

The earth has warmed and cooled for millenia. The earth has gone through various ice ages starting millions of years ago. Some scientists say we are coming out of one now.... So..... What humans were around over the last few millenia polluting the planet to make the planet enter and exit these ice ages?

What are we gonna do - have a flat earther on there every time we talk about the planet just to make it fair ? That's absurd. People are created equal, opinions aren't. Suck it up buttercup..
