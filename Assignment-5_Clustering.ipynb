    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will use a clustering algorithm to analyze our data (i.e. YouTube comments of a single video).\n",
    "This will help us extract topics of discussion.\n",
    "We use the embeddings generated in Assignment 4 as input. \n",
    "(This notebook will not run without first running the assignment 4 Notebook, as it relies on the data in the folder 'output/')\n",
    "Each of our comments has been assigned a vector that encodes information about its meaning.\n",
    "The closer two vectors are, the more similar the meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each vector is of 512 Dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can cluster our data we need to reduce the embeddings' dimensionality to overcome the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "We use the UMAP ALgorithm for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that we use the KMedoids Algorithm to partition the embedding space and generate our clusters this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to define the number of clusters we want to have. \n",
    "To find the optimal number of clusters, we use a simple optimization scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the clusters are created, we visualize them.\n",
    "To do this we reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings again to two dimensions.\n",
    "Then we render a scatterplot of our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore we want to analyze and interpret our clusters.\n",
    "To do this, we:\n",
    "- print some statistics about each of the clusters\n",
    "- print cluster's medoid (the central sample)\n",
    "- print the cluster(s) we want to analyze further"

Climate change denial comes in various forms. Some are stupid enough to deny that CO2 is a ghg. Really bloody stupid as it is the presence of atmospheric CO2 that makes this planet habitable. Some deny that Man could possibly emit enough CO2 to change the climate. The facts and fingerprinting prove they’re cretins. And then there are those who deny that there will be a problem from warming. You’re a denier but too stupid to understand the debate in which you are engaged. Next time you look in the mirror, remember, there’s a silly cap with a D on it resting on your think head.   \n",

Scientists in the pocket of Junk food manufacturers lie for them by telling us their products are good for us. We’ve also been told that high carbohydrate diets are good for us, they have fuelled obesity. The cover up by the establishment of the rape of thousands of girls by Muslim men, the list is endless. For me I have seen the increase in temperature over the last 50 years, I have also experienced first hand the retreat of the glaciers in the mountains. Off course man is influencing climate, but the presentation of it as an absolute truth and wheeling out emotional children will never convince the majority of people. As for the BBC, very biased reporting doesn’t help the case.   \n",

The historic record indicates that temp increases first and CO2 follows hundreds of years later. Antarctic ice cores have shown that. Even your favorite website SkepticalScience admits it and as they always do they twist it to show the unmistakable influence man has on climate. As far as CO2 being food, well, you know as well as I do that CO2 is required for plants to grow which means we get to eat plant food and continue living. You don't know this but over the last 50 years the earth has gotten greener and cereal crop yields have increased dramatically. Go to the U.S. Department of Agriculture website and check it out. I would say that when Boran said \"CO2 is literally our food\" you really knew what he meant. It must be a horrible thing for you and your catastrophic global warming B.S. that CO2 might not be causing devastation but people all over the world might be getting enough to eat.   \n",

I have photos of where I live from the 1970s and the sea looks the same now as it did then. All science is based on first hand observations. Climate \"science\" isn't real science because it's based on models which predict the future, based on incorrect analysis of the supposed warming effect of CO2, which is actually a coolant in the atmosphere.   \n",

Heartland convinced many people that smoking was good for them, and today serves two purposes: tell you that second-hand smoke if OK for your children, and that all climate scientists are wrong but their little band of no-degree and political science people are experts. Some of the cigarette denier &quot;scientists&quot; at Heartland moved onto climate science denial.<br /><br />I think every thinking person should insist that deniers look into Exxon&#39;s own reporting (that they kept hidden) and the BEST program. BEST took a few skeptic scientists (some outright deniers) and funded them with Koch money. But an interesting thing happened when real science was performed: they came to the same conclusions that all other science organizations came to. Remarkable, no?   \n",

When in reality climate activists don't know shit about what they advocate, I have also seen Climate Gate where thousands of scientists from UK/USA and other nations activly partook in changing data to suit what we see now. In short nothing but terrorism from enviromentalists.   \n",

Sydney harbour has been measuring sea level for over 200 years and it shows a constant rise of 2.3mm a year due to land glacier melting and sea level did drop from late 2015 until late 2018 that’s nasa fact. Regarding the sea ice, if all the sea ice melted tomorrow the sea level would hardly rise ( it would only rise because of the small amount of salt in the ice ) sea ice is just like a boat it displaces it’s weight so when it melts it stays at the same level as before, it’s basic scientific fact. https://youtu.be/Dzb8FljvGGI   \n",

This false equivalence or false balance - as it is sometimes described when relating to media - is most glaringly obvious in cases where experts of a certain field have come to a consensus whilst politically it remains divisive. Climate change is one such case but more recently Brexit has been too, particularly pertaining to the economic argument for the latter. The most egregious examples of this kind of behaviour in media are the debate sections that are now a staple of the 24hr news cycle. These gladiatorial bouts between two personalities are preferred over more diligent and enlightening interviews of single positions since, they make “great TV” at the expense of informing the viewer.   \n",

It was a clear and deliberate plan to obfuscate, manipulate and hide evidence (sic). There&#39;s no other conclusion that can be drawn from those actions. What&#39;s more the person who released them was clearly an insider among the same group but came forward the only way they could. Had this been other than left wing psudo science garbage it would have been painted as a revelation and seized upon as fact by the same set of groupthinkers who defended the demonstrable intention revealed within the emails. That being said it was a clever defence... only half wits would fall for it.   \n",

I don't know any Climatologist who ever predicted the first three of your points. But the climate all over the world has undeniably got warmer in the last 30 years. this has happened many times in the past of course (the climate is always in flux). People might disagree what the cause is, but facts are facts, there is currently global warming.   \n",

The temperatures are very suspect - depending on out of the way places and heat island effects. Ice melt and sea level rise (look at NOAA tide charts) do not correlate with fossil fuel CO2. The claims of more extreme weather are totally bogus.   \n",

You think all these hundreds of thousands of people working for government institutions are lying and have been lying constantly for decades?? And you think none of that would come out? Not a single person would step forward??

Because it has a negative connotation and the title of this post says enough. So don't tell me the BBC is not biased. If you want to claim that current warming is not a natural process, then you must be able to exclude the natural processes. But science has still not been able to unravel the causes of natural processes. It is therefore extremely arrogant of institutions such as the IPCC to ignore natural processes. A stable climate on earth is non-existent, it does not exist, it has never existed and it will never exist. You have to reason from that context. All media reports that ignore this context, intentionally or unintentionally, lose their value and can be considered as propaganda.   \n",

It has changed far faster and far more extremely in the long and distant past - many times (long before any generation of humans ruined anyone's future). Go investigate ice ages, or extinction events. this isnt even nearly the biggest fluctuation in the last 20,000 years.   \n",

Do you seriously think the fact that plant need CO2 is an argument? We need water, does that mean we can't drown? Take your time to understand the issue, this isn't politics, this is science and a single disgruntled scientist does not represent the field.   \n",

Climate change denial comes\\nin various forms. Some are stupid enough to deny that CO2 is a ghg. Really\\nbloody stupid as it is the presence of atmospheric CO2 that makes this planet\\nhabitable. Some deny that Man could possibly emit enough CO2 to change the\\nclimate. The facts and fingerprinting prove they’re cretins. And then there\\nare those who deny that there will be a problem from warming. You’re a denier\\nbut too stupid to understand the debate in which you are engaged. Next time\\nyou look in the mirror, remember, there’s a silly cap with a D on it resting\\non your think head.\\n\\n   \n",

The historic record indicates that temp increases\\nfirst and CO2 follows hundreds of years later. Antarctic ice cores have shown\\nthat. Even your favorite website SkepticalScience admits it and as they always\\ndo they twist it to show the unmistakable influence man has on climate. As far\\nas CO2 being food, well, you know as well as I do that CO2 is required for\\nplants to grow which means we get to eat plant food and continue living. You\\ndon't know this but over the last 50 years the earth has gotten greener and\\ncereal crop yields have increased dramatically. Go to the U.S. Department of\\nAgriculture website and check it out. I would say that when Boran said \"CO2 is\\nliterally our food\" you really knew what he meant.

Sydney harbour has been measuring sea level for over 200 years and it\\nshows a constant rise of 2.3mm a year due to land glacier melting and sea\\nlevel did drop from late 2015 until late 2018 that’s nasa fact. Regarding the\\nsea ice, if all the sea ice melted tomorrow the sea level would hardly rise (\\nit would only rise because of the small amount of salt in the ice ) sea ice is\\njust like a boat it displaces it’s weight so when it melts it stays at the\\nsame level as before, it’s basic scientific fact. \\n\\n   \n",

Because it has a negative connotation and the title of this post\\nsays enough. So don't tell me the BBC is not biased. If you want to claim that\\ncurrent warming is not a natural process, then you must be able to exclude the\\nnatural processes. But science has still not been able to unravel the causes\\nof natural processes. It is therefore extremely arrogant of institutions such\\nas the IPCC to ignore natural processes. A stable climate on earth is non-\\nexistent, it does not exist, it has never existed and it will never exist. You\\nhave to reason from that context. All media reports that ignore this context,\\nintentionally or unintentionally, lose their value and can be considered as\\npropaganda.\\n\\n   \n",

       "79   I guess the cars and factories caused the last ice age too, right? Perhaps 11,000 years ago when global temps started rising to end the last ice age, human made C02 cause that as well, right? The shift in the magnetic poles have weakened the protective layers of the ionosphere allowing more of the sun’s rays to heat up oceans, boiling off more of that largest storehouse of C02, releasing it into the atmosphere. It is the sun that is causing temps to rise, dah. This is not new information, just information that you have been taught to ignore.

Sea levels rising across all decades, and it's really REALLY hard to find even a 3-year span that a cherry picker could call a drop. It's a silly exercise. Now that both the Arctic and Antarctic sea ice is melting, it seems the cherry picks are getting very slim indeed.   \n",

But ask yourself this, how much has the temperature increased since the 11th centuary AD? And does this increase compare to a 6C increase in the millenium at the end of the last ice age? Avoid the minutiae of smaller time scales, as it wouldnt be comparing apples with apples. We all realise the global temp has shot up 0.7C in 50 years. but unfortunately we didnt't have sensors milllenia ago to resolve much below 50 yr time frames. It will have done so then too. Remember, the global temp shot up 2C in ONE year after tambora's dip, but that's weather, not climate.   \n",

Man's activities clearly do have an impact but it is probably miniscule. As has been mentioned in other comments during the past 2 million years the earth has gone through repeated chages in climate (ice age to tropical) and the data appears to suggest that the onset of such change was sometimes very rapid - we have no clue why! BTW carbon dioxide levels have actually lagged some of those previous temperature increases not preceded them. That is assuming that we really can measure past gas concentrations! Climate scientists also frequently extrapolate local data to a global scale to \"prove\" their ACC agenda.   \n",

Ocean current shifts and/or solar output increase are the most likely triggers. Snowballing effects to enhance the warming with albedo decrease and also large Methane release. this warming trend almost reversed in the next millenium (as you will now have seen). Only to restart again. No cataclysm of sufficient extent has been identified to co-incide with this - and because it's so recent (comparitively speaking) none will be.   \n",

       "79   I guess the cars and factories caused the last ice age too, right? Perhaps 11,000 years ago when global temps started rising to end the last ice age, human made C02 cause that as well, right? The shift in the magnetic poles have weakened the protective layers of the ionosphere allowing more of the sun’s rays to heat up oceans, boiling off more of that largest storehouse of C02, releasing it into the atmosphere. It is the sun that is causing temps to rise, dah. This is not new information, just information that you have been taught to ignore.

But ask yourself this, how much has the temperature increased since the 11th centuary AD? And does this increase compare to a 6C increase in the millenium at the end of the last ice age? Avoid the minutiae of smaller time scales, as it wouldnt be comparing apples with apples. We all realise the global temp has shot up 0.7C in 50 years. but unfortunately we didnt't have sensors milllenia ago to resolve much below 50 yr time frames. It will have done so then too. Remember, the global temp shot up 2C in ONE year after tambora's dip, but that's weather, not climate.   \n",

Man's activities clearly do have an impact but it is probably miniscule. As has been mentioned in other comments during the past 2 million years the earth has gone through repeated chages in climate (ice age to tropical) and the data appears to suggest that the onset of such change was sometimes very rapid - we have no clue why! BTW carbon dioxide levels have actually lagged some of those previous temperature increases not preceded them. That is assuming that we really can measure past gas concentrations! Climate scientists also frequently extrapolate local data to a global scale to \"prove\" their ACC agenda.   \n",

Remember, the global\\ntemp shot up 2C in ONE year after tambora's dip, but that's weather, not\\nclimate.\\n\\n   \n",
